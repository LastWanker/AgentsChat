    This policy describes the kinds of intentions an Agent may consider.
    It serves as a natural-language guide aligned with agent.py event APIs.
    It does not enforce rules or determine legality.

intentions:

  speak:
    event_type: speak
    description: >
      Speak is the most basic and frequent social action.
      It produces a message visible within the current scope.
    usage_guidance:
      - Use to express thoughts, reasoning, questions, or partial ideas.
      - Speak does not assume a target or require a response.
      - It does not imply commitment or final judgement.
    references_hint:
      - References may be used to reply to, challenge, or extend previous events.
      - Referencing helps establish conversational continuity.
    common_patterns:
      - discussion
      - brainstorming
      - clarification
      - disagreement

  speak_public:
    event_type: speak_public
    description: >
      Speak_public is a forced public broadcast.
      It legally bypasses the current scope and makes the message visible to all.
    usage_guidance:
      - Use when information must reach beyond the current group.
      - Common for group leaders reporting progress to the public.
      - May also be used in urgent or high-impact situations, even without authority.
      - Using this action signals an intentional change of visibility.
    references_hint:
      - References may justify why escalation or public exposure is necessary.
    common_patterns:
      - cross-group escalation
      - public reporting
      - urgent warnings

    description: >
      Request_specific is a public, directed request to a named agent.
      It represents an explicit delegation or commission.
    usage_guidance:
      - Use when a particular agent is relevant or responsible.
      - This action creates clear responsibility and traceability.
      - Requests remain open until closed by a submit.
    references_hint:
      - References may explain why this agent was selected.
    common_patterns:
      - expert assignment
      - task delegation
      - accountable requests

  request_anyone:
    event_type: request_anyone
    description: >
      Request_anyone is a broadcast request without a specified recipient.
      It invites voluntary response or assistance.
    usage_guidance:
      - Use when unsure who can help or when participation is optional.
      - Does not require completion, but allows later adoption.

    references_hint:
      - References may indicate what triggered the need for help.
    common_patterns:
      - open help request
      - voluntary task claiming

  request_all:
    event_type: request_all
    description: >

    usage_guidance:
      - Use to respond to a request event.
      - Submit implies fulfillment, not discussion.
      - Visibility may vary depending on delivery context.
      - When responding to request_all, submit represents an individual vote or decision input.
        Collective outcomes typically depend on multiple submit events.

    references_hint:
      - References may define the context or prior discussion leading to the decision.
    common_patterns:
      - voting
      - consensus building
      - collective rule declaration

      - Use to respond to a request event.
      - Submit implies fulfillment, not discussion.
      - Visibility may vary depending on delivery context.

    description: >

      It carries implicit attitude or stance.
    usage_guidance:
